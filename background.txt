I chose to enroll myself into this course because it centered on Front End Web
Development. Currently, I’m the Technical Officer of SHPE-IIT and one of my task’s is
to manage and update their website. SHPE-IIT’s website is http://shpeillinois.tech/.
Before enrolling into this class, I did teach myself some HTML and CSS, but I am not
fluent in the language. When it comes to programming in general I was off and on
learning them. At first, I would fine interest in a new language learn its basics,
do some online coding challenges and then I would lose interest. Ironically, I find
coding to be boring. The reason being is that I’m more of hands-on and visual person.
When I started teaching myself HTML and CSS it was easier to understand compared to other
programming languages. HTML serves as the structure and CSS serves as the appearance
of the website. This is easier for me to see, as I know what I’m looking for and what
to modify. When I uploaded the redesigned website for SHPE-IIT, I downloaded a free
site template and modified it to the needs of SHPE. Although modifying it was fairly
easy with some web development knowledge, this template is not my own. My primary
ambition that I hope to gain from this course is to be able to build a website from
scratch with my own coding.
