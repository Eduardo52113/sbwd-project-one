		<h2>Background(Who am I?)</h2>
		<p1>
		  I’m Eduardo Perez a First-Generation Latino College Student pursing a Bachelor of
		  Science in Computer Engineering at Illinois Tech, and oldest of three siblings in a family
		  of five. Thinking about what to put in my background paragraph made me realize where I’m at
		  in my college career and what have I accomplished so far. Back in High School, when we took
		  that dumb test called “The ACT”. I remember teachers saying that the ACT score determines where
		  and what you are going to do in college. The score ranged from 0 to 36, which 36 was the highest
		  score to achieve. I studied and prepared for the test knowing that I want to pursue a pathway into
		  engineering which had an average in the range of 25 to 33. But when I got the test results in the
		  mail, I got a 13. At the times it was an embarrassment and I never revealed my score to friends then.
		  After my many applications to get into an engineering out of high school, only one accepted me.
		  But I declined it because of family and financial reasons. But that one acceptance gave me hope at the
		  time saying that I can get into an engineering school. My college career started at Wilbur Wright Community
		  College and through my community college I joined student’s organization, attend a science conference at
		  California, got accepted into a High-Altitude Ballooning summer research program, and most importantly got
		  accepted and transferred into my engineering school of my primary choice. Being this far in my academic career,
		  I look back at my ACT results and I laugh at it. Thinking that score was going to determine my academic
		  career, Ha! That score means nothing to me anymore. Hard work pays off. I’m technical a senior, but I’m
		  expected to graduate in Spring 2020. One day that degree will be in my hands.

		<h3>My career at Illinois Tech and beyond.</h3>
		<p2>
		  I transferred into Illinois Tech in Fall 2016 from Wilbur Wright Community College.
		  Being my first time entering as a student into a university student, I felt overwhelm.
		  As my professor in my community told me “you’ll be a small fish in an ocean”. I only had one
		  other two other friends that transferred with me into IIT, but they were mechanical engineering
		  majors. But we met common ground through SHPE-IIT. I thankful that I joined SHPE-IIT because they
		  made me feel welcomed to Illinois Tech. As their motto is one word “Familia”. Through SHPE, I
		  networked and made friends with those pursuing in the same major. Later, I became their Technical
		  Officer on their board. They helped me board my vision into the engineering field and the pathways
		  to pursue. Another student organization, I current apart of is IIT’s NASA Robotics Mining team.
		  Being a part of this, help increase my skill set as it applied the theories that were learned in
		  class into building a mining robot for the annual NASA mining competition. I’m looking forward to
		  build and go to competition in May of 2019. Through IIT, I got an invitation to visit and network
		  software engineers at Google’s Chicago office in the west loop. This one initiation I never excepted,
		  it reassured my confidence that I can complete my degree and achieve my goals. My goals after IIT are
		  still in the thinking process. But if I could think of one goal, it would to be in a area similar to Maker Space
		  that has tools readily available to build things, solve problems, and educate other in becoming problem solvers.

		<h4>Ambition for this course</h4>
		<p3>
		  I chose to enroll myself into this course because it centered on Front End Web
		  Development. Currently, I'm the Technical Officer of SHPE-IIT and one of my task's is
		  to manage and update their website. SHPE-IIT's website is <a href="http://shpeillinois.tech/" target="_blank">shpeillinois.tech</a>.
		  Before enrolling into this class, I did teach myself some HTML and CSS, but I am not
		  fluent in the language. When it comes to programming in general I was off and on
		  learning them. At first, I would fine interest in a new language learn its basics,
		  do some online coding challenges and then I would lose interest. Ironically, I find
		  coding to be boring. The reason being is that I'm more of hands-on and visual person.
		  When I started teaching myself HTML and CSS it was easier to understand compared to other
		  programming languages. HTML serves as the structure and CSS serves as the appearance
		  of the website. This is easier for me to see, as I know what I'm looking for and what
		  to modify. When I uploaded the redesigned website for SHPE-IIT, I downloaded a free
		  site template and modified it to the needs of SHPE. Although modifying it was fairly
		  easy with some web development knowledge, this template is not my own. My primary
		  ambition that I hope to gain from this course is to be able to build a website from
		  scratch with my own coding.
